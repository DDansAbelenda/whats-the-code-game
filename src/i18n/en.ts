For example:\n- If the secret code is 102 and you enter 111, you will receive the following feedback:\n • 1 digit is correct and well placed.\n • 2 digits are correct but wrong placed.\n\nNote: Repeating digits is a valid strategy, but keep in mind how it affects the feedback you receive. Good luck!",
