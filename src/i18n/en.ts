  instructionsText:"The goal of the game is to uncover a code made up of unique digits (no repetitions) ranging from 0 to 9.\n\nBefore starting, you can select a difficulty level, which determines the number of attempts available and the points gained or lost depending on the outcome.\n\nDuring the game, input a number and click 'Submit Guess'.\n- If the number matches the hidden code, you win, earn points based on the level, and can choose to play again or return to the main menu.\n- If it doesn’t match, the attempt is recorded in the 'Previous Guesses' section, where you’ll receive hints about the secret code based on your input, and your remaining attempts decrease. If you run out of attempts without guessing the code, you lose the game and points are deducted according to the level.\n\nGame statistics are available in the top bar (bars icon).\n\nIf you enter a number with repeated digits, each digit will be evaluated individually as unique. For example:\n- If the secret code is 102 and you enter 111, you’ll receive this feedback:\n  • 1 digit is correct and in the correct position.\n  • 2 digits are correct but in the wrong positions.\n\nNote: Repeating numbers is a valid strategy, but consider how it affects the hints. Good luck!",
